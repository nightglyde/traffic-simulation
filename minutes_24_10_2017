the plan:

until thursday, work on getting my group project ready for presentation
however, i don't have to spend all day on that. i could also do some work on my reading-and-writing-about-abstracts

i could work on stuff after my presentation on thursday, before the 2:30 meeting
i could write my daily schedule then, so that i can have a daily routine

turn my super-rough-summaries-doc into an overleaf latex doc
send mark the overleaf link by thursday or friday

by the weekend, i want to be turning my article-summaries into a document structure for my literature review
send the rough lit review plan to mark at the start of the week
talk about it during tuesday meeting
at that point, there will be a week and 2 days before the due date.
